Hello. 



This is a folder with the labs files. 

I made for the course "Artificial Intelligence". 

Halmstad university course Machine Learning DT8052. 

In order to analyze this files. You must have python installed in your local machine. 

Then cmd -> jupyter notebook. 

There you can see how the code is made and its limitations.
