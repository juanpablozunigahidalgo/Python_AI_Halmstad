    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Add a text that describes the x-axis (Feature 0) and y-axis (Feature 1).\n",
    " - We can add a text to describe the first dimension using `ax.set_xlabel(\"...\")`, and a text to describe the second dimension using `ax.set_ylabel(\"...\")`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use a personalized color and a personalized marker for our data-points.\n",
    " - When calling the `ax.scatter(...)` function, can specify a color (e.g. `\"red\"`) and a marker (e.g. `\"x\"`) as follows: `ax.scatter(values_at_feature_0, values_at_feature_1, color=\"red\", marker=\"x\")`. There are several possible markers, some of them are: `\"x\"`, `\"o\"`, `\".\"`, `\"+\"`, `\">\"` ... etc. You can also use any predefined letter as a marker, for example, to use the letter R, your marker should be: `\"$R$\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Use a legend text to describe something about your data-points.\n",
    " - To do so, when calling the `ax.scatter(...)` function we can specify a label (i.e. some text) as follows: `ax.scatter(values_at_feature_0, values_at_feature_1, color=\"red\", marker=\"x\", label=\"All My Points\")`. Then, we need to call `ax.legend()` to make the legend text appear.\n",
